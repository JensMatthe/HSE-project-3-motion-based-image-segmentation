#This code concerns an individual project within my course in Neural Networks and Deep Learning at Higher School of Economics, Moscow.
#The project was based on lessons from Fast AI with the academic supervision of Sergey Lisitsyn (lecturer at HSE and Data Scientist at Yandex).
#It was my third project for this course with a dataset with footage from a dashcam and masks for image separation.
