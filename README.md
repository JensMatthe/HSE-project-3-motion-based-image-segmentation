# HSE-project-3-motion-based-image-segmentation
#This code concerns an individual project within my course in Neural Networks and Deep Learning at Higher School of Economics, Moscow.
#The project was based on lessons from Fast AI with the academic super vision of Sergey Lisitsyn (lecturer at HSE and Data Scientist at Yandex).
#It was my third project for this course with a dataset with footage from a dashcam and masks for image separation.
